       <p>As someone who was personally effected by cancer, it has had a huge effect on me day to day.
        my father passed away when I was 3. Sarcoma is a bitch. When I was a child my sister and I raised 10,000 for Relay for Life.
        I want to continue raising money for cancer, So i have decided to donate 40 % of all proceeds to cancer research.
